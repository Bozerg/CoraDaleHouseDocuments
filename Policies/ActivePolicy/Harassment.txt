Policy against harassment

Harassment is persistent unwanted attention. Harassment is not tolerated in the Clubhouse, because the Clubhouse needs to be a safe place for all members and staff.

Harassment can take many forms: Threats, pestering, stalking, phone calls, ...

Unwanted touching is assault and/or sexual harassment. Sexual harassment could include:
  –unwanted sexual advances
  –unwanted physical contact
  –unsolicited remarks of a sexual nature
  –gestures or actions which may reasonably be construed as sexual and offensive
  –attempts to intimidate someone into having sexual contact
  –display or circulation of derogatory or sexually explicit written material or images

If you experience harassment in the Clubhouse or on Clubhouse activities or property, you have the right to report it to staff. All reports will be investigated, and you will be informed what actions are taken. If you feel that your complaint was not handled appropriately, you have the right to contact any member of the board.

If you harass someone in the Clubhouse or on Clubhouse activities or property, consequences may include:
  1.Verbal warning.
  2.Suspension, for the day or longer; in some cases, you will need to meet with the director before returning.
  3.Probationary period.
  4.Loss of membership.

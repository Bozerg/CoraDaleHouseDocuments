Conflict of Interest Policy and Annual Statement for Board Members and Staff

The purpose of this policy is to assure that ECC board and staff do not use their positions of authority or trust at ECC for personal gain, and to make our processes transparent to avoid the appearance of such gain.

Board members and staff shall avoid using their positions of influence or their decision-making authority to direct ECC or ECC member or supporters' business or contracts toward entities in which they or their immediate family have a financial interest.

Whenever a potential conflict of interest arises, the affected board or staff member shall disclose the potential conflict and recuse themselves from deliberations on the matter. Such disclosure shall be in the case of staff to the Executive Director, and in the case of the Executive Director or a board member to the board as a whole.

The Executive Director and the Board shall work to assure that decision-making processes remain focused on carrying out the vision and program of ECC and are not distracted or diverted to other purposes.

This policy will be reviewed annually as part of board and staff evaluation processes, and at that time all board and staff members will update and sign a conflict of interest disclosure form.

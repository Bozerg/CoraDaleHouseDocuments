Member Post-Suspension Process

When someone has been suspended, we want to be both clear about the process and flexible regarding the time-frame.

Process: The executive director or a staff member willmaintain contact with the suspended member. During the suspension the ED will assess for indications of some stability and comprehension in the suspended member of what brought on the suspension. The ED will discuss expectations of respectful interaction and the suspended member will acknowledge and agree to the expectations. The ED will also assess for sense of safety and outline expectations with the clubhouse community before suspended member can return.

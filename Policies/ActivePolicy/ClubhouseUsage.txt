Clubhouse Usage Policy

POLICY
We welcome use of the Clubhouse by outside groups that share and support our mission and vision.
We favor events that are open and accessible to any Clubhouse members.

PROCESS
Requests by outside groups for use of the Clubhouse will be considered based on factors including:
	–how this would support our mission
	–how this may benefit Clubhouse relationships with the community
	–the potential for conflicts with Clubhouse use of space.

A written memo of expectations will be developed with any outside group using Clubhouse facilities, and a staff member will be assigned as contact person for the group.

Decisions about single events may be made by Clubhouse colleagues, with board members informed of use. Requests for ongoinguse may be made by Clubhouse colleagues with board counsel. Agreements for ongoing use will be evaluated at regular intervals, described in the memo of expectations.

Policy on Leaves of Absences

In order to foster a healthy, inclusive, and consensus-oriented model of governance, any member of the board may take a self-imposed leave of absence, or the board may place a member of the board on a leave of absence in accordance with the provisions in section B.v.b. Placing a member of the board on a leave of absence should be used only as a way to ensure healthy board functioning in accordance with an inclusive and conscientious decision-making process. Such measures should not be used to circumvent good process or to silence or marginalize minority voices.

Such a leave of absence may affect the board member's standing on any subcommittees of the board as the board sees fit.
At the time of the leave, the board and the member will establish a time frame to re-evaluate the leave.

Board members who are on a leave of absence:
1. May be invited to return from their leave of absence at the board's discretion. The board shall periodically review the standing of any board members on leave in order to re-evaluate a potential return to the board as a matter of fit.
2. Will refrain from attending meetings of the board or participating in board responsibilities or decision-making except as the board sees fit.
3. Will only count as members of the board forquorum or consensus requirements after reinstatement on the board.
4. Will only have a vote in any voting matters of the board after reinstatement on the board.
5. Board member terms and term limits continue to apply to members of the board who are on leave.
6. Members of the board who are on leave may be removed from the board under the provisions contained in section B.v.b.

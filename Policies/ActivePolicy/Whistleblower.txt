Whistleblower Protection Policy

The support of all employees is necessary to achieving compliance with various laws, regulations and appropriate standards of operation. 

This policy relates to any employee who has knowledge of an activity, policy or practice of Elkhart County Clubhouse (ECC) that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule or regulation mandated pursuant to law, or is in violation of a clear mandate or public policy concerning health, safety, welfare, or protection of the environment. In such case, the employee is expected to bring the alleged unlawful activity, policy, or practice to the attention of the Executive Director and provide the Executive Director with a reasonable opportunity to investigate and correct the alleged unlawful activity. If the allegations are against the Executive Director, it should be brought to the attention of the Board. In either case, if this is done the protections below are available to the employee:

–ECC will not retaliate against an employee who, in good faith, has made a protest or raised a complaint against some practice of ECC, or of another individual or entity with whom ECC had a business relationship, on the basis of a reasonable belief that the practice is in violation of law or a clear mandate of public policy.

–ECC will not retaliate against an employee who discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or a public body any activity, policy, or practice of ECC that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, or a rule, or regulation mandated pursuant to law or is in violation of a clear mandate or public policy concerning health, safety, welfare, or protection of the environment.

Policy for Requesting Board/Director Consultation

If an individual brings a concern about operational decisions or actions taken by the Executive Director, and has already pursued the matter with the ED without resolution, this may become an occasion for consultation. The following process will be implemented:
	
	a. A listening committee will be formed in one of the following ways:
		
		i.the individual can go to the Executive Director to request a listening committee be convened and invite a board memberto participate. If either the ED or the board member believes that the concern merits a listening committee, the board member and ED will invite a second board member. Either board member may decline if their relationship with the individual would make this role inappropriate.

		ii.the individual can go directly to any board member who will then notify the ED. If either the ED or the board member believes that the concern merits a listening committee, the ED and board member will invite a second board member; either board member may decline if their relationship with the individual would make this role inappropriate. 

	b. The individualwill explain their concern to the listening committee. The role of the Board members in this meeting is to listen and clarify the concern, not to mediate. The person bringing the concern may if shehe chooses bring a witness to support himher by their presence.

	c. The two Board members will then consultwith the Executive Director on the issues raised and offer counsel for addressing the concern, based on clubhouse standards. The group may seek additional information and counsel from within the clubhouse organization or from outside, as it sees fit.

	d. Executive Director and the individual who raised the concernwill then meet to outline a plan for addressing the concern and the two Board members will be present as witnesses.

	e. The two Board members will give a report to the full Board.

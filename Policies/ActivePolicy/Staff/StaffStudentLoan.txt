Cora Dale House Employee Student Loan policy

The “standard” repayment rate is a 10-year schedule, or 120 monthly payments; in some cases, the lender will allow “extended” repayment, which may be 316 payments (26.33 years). The extended payments could be a good choice if some kind of forgiveness of the balance might be available after 10 years, or if it is important to reduce the monthly payments.

Since July 2014 we have committed to pick up educational loan repayments on the following terms:
  1. Beginning after nine months of employment or when loans come due, whichever is later,
  2. At either a standard (10-yr, or 120 payment) rate or an extended payment rate when the total annual payments are under $3000,
  3. At an extended payment rate when the annual payments would be over $3000 at the standard rate. Our payments on your educational loans count as income, are reported as income on your W-2 and are taxable.

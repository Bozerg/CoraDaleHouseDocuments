High Medical Cost Reimbursement Policy

1. Cora Dale House offers each employee a health coverage bonus – a salary bonus paid to any employee who provides evidence of health insurance.

2. Because we do not offer a workplace group plan, our employees who are not eligible for a partner’s workplace plan have been eligible for subsidies in the ACA marketplace. Some of our employees have been covered through partner’s plans; a majority of employees have historically chosen “high-deductible” commercial health insurance.

3. We cooperate with payroll deductions for a Health Savings Account (HSA) for any employee who wishes to use this for pre-tax saving for health costs.

4. If an employee has combined premiums and medical costs beyond $6000 in one policy year, they are eligible to submit those in excess of $6000 for 75% reimbursement, up to a maximum of $3000 reimbursement for up to $4000 of expenses.

5. We will re-evaluate this policy periodically to consider changes as the health insurance environment changes or as the needs of our employees change.

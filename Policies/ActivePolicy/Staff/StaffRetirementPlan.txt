Cora Dale House SEP-IRA Retirement Plan Policy

Since July 2014 Cora Dale House has made contributions to an SEP-IRA of 8% of base salary for all staff. This benefit begins after three months of employment, for all staff 20 years old and older. We will deposit this moneyto an Everence Trust Fund; you will need to meet with an Everence advisor to decide how you want your IRA invested.

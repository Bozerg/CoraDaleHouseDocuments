Procedure for adding new members to the Board

When the Board wishes to bring additional perspectives to the Board Circle, it will authorize a Nominating Committee to lead.
	
1. The Nominating Committee will bring a name or names of nominees tothe Board Circle, with relevant information about the nominees.

2. The Board Circle can authorize the Nominating Committee to meet with the nominee, and further, to invite the nominee to join the Board Circleas a guest in discernment of board service, if the members of the Nominating have consensus on this step.

3. After a nominee joins in a Board Circle as a guest, the board will decide whether to invite the nominee to join the board. If both the board and the nominee agree in the affirmative, the nominee will then be a full board member, beginning a three-year term unless other terms are defined.

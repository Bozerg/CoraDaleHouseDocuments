Policy for appointing new Clubhouse board members.

In selecting members the board will focus on how prospective members will furtherthe vision of the ECC, on having the board as a whole reflect the diversity of the community, and on maintaining connection with other related community groups.

1. In conjunction with annual board self-evaluation, or more frequently if a prospective board member who could enhance the functioning of the board as a whole has come to the attention of the Director (and in consultation with the board) the board will evaluate its composition and how it fits with the criteria above from the bylaws. In making that evaluation the board will also consider how the size of the board serves or detracts from board function and consensus decision-making.

2. If, in the course of that evaluation it seems helpful to add new board members, the Director will consult with Clubhouse colleagues to propose a name or names to bring to the board for consideration. Potential candidates will be considered basedon the following:
  how they would further the vision of Clubhouse
  how they would help the board reflect the diversity of the community, and 
  how they would help the board maintain connection with other related groups.

3. The board will review the name(s) presented and decide whom to invite as prospective new board members. This process may include selected boardmembers meeting with prospective candidates. The number of candidates invited and who they are will be based on an assessment of how they would enhance thevision and function of the board as a whole with an emphasis on fit.

4. Candidates will be given an opportunity to attend one or several board meetings and, if the fit seems good to all involved, will be invited to join the board.

5. Actions to add board members will be recorded in the minutes of the boardand a current roster of board members and their terms will be maintained at the Clubhouse office.

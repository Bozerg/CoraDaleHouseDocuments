Emergency Committee of the Elkhart County Clubhouse Board

In the event that the Executive Director should be incapacitated or if allegations of malfeasance by the ED come to the board, it shall be the responsibility of the Emergency Committee to take necessary steps to provide for protection of the Clubhouse and continuity in operations. This committee is authorized to act when they have unanimity on such decisions as they believe are necessary and urgent, including but not limited to suspension of the ED and appointment of an Interim Director.

If allegations of ED malfeasance reach any board member, these allegations should be referred to the Emergency Committee. If the members of the Emergency Committee believe that the concern merits a listening committee, then the Emergency Committee will function as that listening committee and will initiate the process of hearing the concern, and decide on appropriate action.

The Emergency Committee is authorized to act on behalf of the board until a board meeting, and will report any actions (including any business tabled for lack of consensus) to the next Board Planning Meeting or Board Circle Meeting, whichever meeting comes first. All decisions of the Emergency Committee will be in effect only until the next Board Circle meeting. The Board Circle shall ratify or supersede any decisions of the Emergency Committee, and will, if necessary, appoint a committee to continue any work initiated by the Emergency Committee.

The Emergency Committee will be appointed by the Board Circle, with membership reviewed annually in the Board self-review process.

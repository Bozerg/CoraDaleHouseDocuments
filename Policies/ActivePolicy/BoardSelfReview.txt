Policy on Board Self-Review

This policy is designed to assure that the board as a whole periodically reflects on how it is functioning, and considers whether an appropriate variety of perspectives in the community are present in its deliberations. 

Flowing out of its strategic planning, the board will annually evaluate how it is doing. It will reflect on the following context and questions:

	A.Empowering administrative staff leadership:
		1.How has the board’s function enhanced or empowered administrative staff leadership?
		2.How has the board’s function detracted from or disempowered administrative staff leadership?
		3.What opportunities present themselves to improve the living out of ECC’s mission with respect to the board empowering administrative staff leadership?

	B.Promoting Clubhouse to the mental health community, and in the community at large
		1.How has the board’s function enhanced clubhouse in the community?
		2.How has the board’s function detracted from clubhouse in the community?
		3.What opportunities present themselves to improve the living out of ECC’s mission in relation to the mental health community and the community at large?

	C.Board internal functioning
		1.How has the board’s internal function enhanced the mission of our clubhouse?
		2.How has the board’s internal function detracted from the mission of our clubhouse?
		3.What opportunities present themselves to improve the living out of ECC’s mission in the board’s internal functioning?

Arising out of these discussions the ECC board will assess whether its deliberations include appropriate perspectives that reflect the diversity of the community. Are there missing perspectives? Are there perspectives that are over-represented? These considerations will inform the board nominating process.

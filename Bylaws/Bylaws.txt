A Clubhouse for Elkhart County
Bylaws

1. Identity
	The vision of Elkhart County Clubhouse (hereafter ECC) is to be a community of recovery, hope, and dignity that empowers people with mental illness through friendship, meaningful work, and cultivation of strengths, building on the clubhouse model and standards formulated by the International Center for Clubhouse Development.

2. Board of Directors
	A. Composition
		The board of directors will consist of 8-12 board members (the number subject to change by board resolution), elected by the board to staggered 3-year terms. Board members are limited to two successive terms unless the board by a 2/3 vote requests that an individual board member serve an additional term. Serving at least 18 months of a term counts as serving a term for purposes of this term limit. After being off the board for at least one year, former board members may be reappointed to the board. In selecting members the board will focus on how prospective members will further the vision of the ECC, on having the board as a whole reflect the diversity of the community, and on maintaining connection with other related community groups. The board may further define board selection and review processes in policies.

	B. Board meetings
		The procedures outlined below are designed to allow for expedient decision-making while protecting the voices of all board members in the process. Procedural maneuvers should not be used to sideline or silence other board members.
			
			i.Regular meetings
				The board shall adopt a schedule of regular meetings (at least quarterly). This schedule can only be modified at a regular meeting of the board (by consensus), and changes in schedule require at least twenty days written (or e-mail) notice to board members not present. Those present at a regular board meeting constitute a quorum. Any non-consensus agenda items for regular meetings (e.g., bylaws amendments, removal of Executive Director, removal of board member), must be announced to board members in writing at least one week prior to the meeting. This and all notification requirements can be waived by unanimous consent of all members of the board (in person or in writing).

			ii.Special meetings
				Special meetings of the board can be called by three members of the board, or by the Executive Director acting alone (not more than once a quarter if called by the Executive Director alone), and require a one-week written notice (except by unanimous consent of all board members). Special meetings require the presence of the Executive Director (except when the only announced agenda is disciplinary action against the Executive Director), and 2/3 of board members for a quorum. (The Executive Director may, if he/she cannot attend a special meeting, permit the meeting to proceed without his/her presence.) All agenda items for special meetings must be stipulated when the meeting is called and announced along with the meeting time and place. Meeting times and places shall be designed to maximize participation within necessary time constraints of urgent agenda.

			iii.Decisions without meetings
				With the unanimous consent of all board members, the board can make a decision without a meeting. The consent to such decision shall be confirmed in writing.

			iv.Remote participation
				Although face to face deliberation is preferred, if a member of the board cannot attend a meeting the board will allow them to participate from another location.

			v.Decision-making
				The board will take counsel together and make decisions by consensus. In this context consensus means that no decision will be made until all members in attendance are willing to proceed and can live with the proposed decision. The following are exempt from consensus requirements, but require a two/thirds majority:

					a. A decision to remove from office or sanction the executive director
					b. A decision to remove from office or sanction a board member
					c. A resolution to change the composition of the committee empowered to act in extreme measures, outlined in 2.D.below.
					d. A decision to amend the bylaws (see later section on bylaws amendment)

				Although these decisions do not requiring consensus, the board should endeavor to fashion a process of careful listening and discernment, so that even these decisions reflectvalues of respect and inclusive decision-making.
